            <p>I&apos;ve always loved creating things and have a natural draw to problem-solving, especially when it involves technology. After discovering a passion for coding, I took the leap and enrolled in a Software Development bootcamp, an experience I thoroughly enjoyed. Since graduating, I&apos;ve been committed to growing my skills, constantly learning new technologies while deepening my understanding of the ones I&apos;ve already mastered. Whether it&apos;s a new project, troubleshooting a bug or building an API, I&apos;m always ready for a new challenge.</p>
